This is a small website where I am to post some blogposts
as well as visual showcases of some things that I build.

Main idea was to keep it light and simple and markdown based
(mainly) in order to lower the bar for putting new things on
it.

Furthermore, self hosting it on my server at home, and having
automatically deploy changes makes it very manageable. And 
low cost for me :) since I only have to pay for domain name.

I am not a web developer, and therefore I wont make it very
convoluted, but aim to use it to ship out other projects with
as low effort as possible. Will add other features to the page
if I deem it necessary.
